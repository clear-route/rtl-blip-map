# Execution Plan: D3.js RTL Prioritization Matrix - Further Modifications

This document outlines the execution plan for further modifying the D3.js visualization of the RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix to add more initiatives and enhance layout, based on user feedback.

## Goal
Further modify the D3.js 'RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix' to add more initiatives, aiming for at least 4 items per quadrant (Quick Wins, Big Bets, Fill-ins, Time Sinks), and enhance blip placement logic for clarity with more items.

## Plan Steps

- [x] **Step 1 (Index 0):** Establish project codebase in sandbox: if new, collaboratively determine name, attempt remote creation via github.create_repository (if available), then clone/init locally. If existing, clone. Then, process project-specific instruction files or README.md. This foundational context is paramount.
  *   **Result:** Successfully verified the existing project codebase 'rtl-blip-map' in the sandbox at '/workspace/rtl-blip-map'. File listing and last git commit (d4977f0 docs: Add execution plan for D3 matrix modifications) confirm it's the correct baseline for the new modifications.
  *   **Summary:** Confirmed existing project codebase and its latest state in sandbox.
- [x] **Step 2 (Index 1):** Thoroughly understand the task and existing codebase (if any), guided by project rules. Analyze structure, conventions, and relevant files. Research external information and clarify ambiguities with the user until a solid understanding is achieved.
  *   **Result:** Thoroughly understood the task for further modifications to the D3.js matrix: add ~7 new initiatives to populate quadrants to at least 4 items each ('Refine Test Strategy Doc', 'Basic Secrets Vault Setup' for Quick Wins; 'Launch Basic Developer Hub (MVP)', 'Optimize Key CI Pipeline' for Fill-ins; 'Manual Regression for All Changes', 'Over-customizing COTS Tools', '100% Test Automation Blindly' for Time Sinks). This requires updating script.js (initiativesData, significantly enhancing drawBlips placement/jitter logic for up to 6 items/quadrant, updating legend for new 'Secure' phase color) and data.md. Existing codebase and conventions are clear.
  *   **Summary:** Understood further modification tasks: add ~7 new initiatives, enhance blip placement for density.
- [x] **Step 3 (Index 2):** Develop a modular high-level architectural plan, define a comprehensive testing strategy, and consider key non-functional requirements. Emphasize creating small, focused code units.
  *   **Result:** Developed an architectural plan for further modifications to the D3.js matrix. Plan includes: updating 'initiativesData' in script.js with ~7 new initiatives (to ensure >=4 per quadrant) including a new 'Secure' RTL Phase/color; significantly enhancing 'drawBlips()' placement/jitter logic for up to 4-6 items per quadrant using more structured patterns (e.g., 2x2 grid); ensuring 'drawLegends()' dynamically includes the new 'Secure' phase; and updating 'data.md' with new initiative details. Testing will focus on visual clarity of the denser diagram and data accuracy.
  *   **Summary:** Planned further D3.js matrix modifications: add ~7 new initiatives, significantly enhance blip placement logic for density.
- [x] **Step 4 (Index 3):** Validate the architectural plan and testing strategy with the user to ensure alignment and gather feedback.
  *   **Result:** User confirmed alignment with the architectural plan and testing strategy for further D3.js matrix modifications. The plan to add ~7 new initiatives, introduce a 'Secure' RTL Phase/color, significantly enhance 'drawBlips()' placement logic for density, update 'data.md', and ensure the 'drawLegends()' function correctly includes the new 'Secure' phase was approved. Testing will focus on visual clarity and data accuracy.
  *   **Summary:** Validated plan for further D3.js modifications with user; user approved.
- [x] **Step 5 (Index 4):** Dynamically generate a detailed blueprint of implementation steps. Each step must cover code, tests (per strategy), documentation, quality checks, and commits, emphasizing modularity. Use 'manage_plan_step' to insert these into the plan.
  *   **Result:** Successfully generated and inserted a detailed blueprint of 4 high-level sub-steps (plan steps 6 through 9) for the *further modifications* to the D3.js visualization and documentation. These cover updates to script.js (adding ~7 new initiatives, enhancing blip placement logic, updating legends for new 'Secure' phase), updates to data.md for new initiatives, and a final commit for these further modifications.
  *   **Summary:** Generated and inserted 4 blueprint sub-steps for further D3.js chart modifications (more initiatives, enhanced layout).
- [x] **Step 6 (Index 5):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.1: Add ~7 new initiatives to script.js and significantly enhance blip placement logic.
  *   **Result:** Successfully modified 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/'. 
1. Added 7 new initiatives to 'initiativesData' (total 18 items), populating all quadrants with at least 4 items. Introduced 'Secure' RTL Phase with color #8A2BE2 and assigned new items the smallest 'aiSize' (7px).
2. Significantly enhanced 'drawBlips()' placement/jitter logic with structured patterns (e.g., 2x2, 2x3 grids) to handle increased blip density per quadrant clearly, while maintaining label legibility.
  *   **Summary:** Updated script.js: added 7 new initiatives, significantly enhanced blip placement logic for density.
- [x] **Step 7 (Index 6):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.2: Ensure RTL Phase Legend in script.js dynamically includes new 'Secure' phase/color.
  *   **Result:** Verified that the 'drawLegends()' function in 'script.js' will dynamically include the new 'Secure' RTL Phase and its color in the legend due to its existing logic of deriving unique phases from 'initiativesData'. No code changes to the function itself were required for this step. The file state was confirmed by a re-write.
  *   **Summary:** Ensured RTL Phase Legend in script.js dynamically handles the new 'Secure' phase.
- [x] **Step 8 (Index 7):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.3: Update data.md to document ~7 new initiatives.
  *   **Result:** Successfully updated 'data.md' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/'. Appended sections detailing 7 new initiatives ('Refine Test Strategy Doc', 'Basic Secrets Vault Setup', 'Launch Basic Developer Hub (MVP)', 'Optimize Key CI Pipeline', 'Manual Regression for All Changes', 'Over-customizing COTS Tools', '100% Test Automation Blindly') with their attributes, Value/Effort rationale, and quadrant placement. The file now documents 18 initiatives.
  *   **Summary:** Updated data.md to document the 7 new initiatives, now totaling 18.
- [x] **Step 9 (Index 8):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.4: Commit all further modification changes.
  *   **Result:** Successfully committed the further modifications to 'script.js' (now with 18 initiatives, enhanced blip placement logic) and 'data.md' (now documenting 18 initiatives) to the local Git repository in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map'. Commit message: 'feat: Add 7 new initiatives to populate quadrants and enhance blip layout'.
  *   **Summary:** Committed further modification changes (script.js with 18 items, data.md) to local Git.

- [ ] **Step 10 (Index 9):** Document the complete, detailed execution plan (including all dynamically generated steps) in a markdown file within the project's plans directory in the sandbox.
- [ ] **Step 11 (Index 10):** Perform final comprehensive validation: ensure all code compiles and all defined tests pass for the entire solution in the sandbox.
- [ ] **Step 12 (Index 11):** Conduct a final code quality and security review, leveraging MCP tools if available. Plan for or execute minor self-corrections if issues are found.
- [ ] **Step 13 (Index 12):** Make a final commit of all implemented changes, including any fixes from the quality review. If remote repository information is available, push the code.
- [ ] **Step 14 (Index 13):** Prepare a clear and concise summary of the completed work, how it meets the goal, and any relevant notes for the user. This will be part of the final completion message.

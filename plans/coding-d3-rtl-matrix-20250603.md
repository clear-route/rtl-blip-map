# Execution Plan: D3.js RTL Prioritization Matrix

This document outlines the execution plan for creating the D3.js visualization of the RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix.

## Goal
Code up the 'RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix' diagram using D3.js, capturing all specified details, and create a GitHub repository for it at clear-route/rtl-blip-map.

## Plan Steps

- [x] **Step 1 (Index 0):** Establish project codebase in sandbox: if new, collaboratively determine name, attempt remote creation via github.create_repository (if available), then clone/init locally. If existing, clone. Then, process project-specific instruction files or README.md. This foundational context is paramount.
  *   **Result:** Successfully created the GitHub repository 'clear-route/rtl-blip-map' and cloned it into the sandbox environment at /workspace/rtl-blip-map.
  *   **Summary:** Created GitHub repository and cloned it into the sandbox. Project codebase established.
- [x] **Step 2 (Index 1):** Thoroughly understand the task and existing codebase (if any), guided by project rules. Analyze structure, conventions, and relevant files. Research external information and clarify ambiguities with the user until a solid understanding is achieved.
  *   **Result:** Thorough understanding of the task to create the 'RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix' using D3.js achieved. Project structure (index.html, style.css, script.js) confirmed. Key diagram specifications (title, axes, quadrants, 8 initiatives with color/size/labels, legends) are clear. Assumptions made: blips will be visually balanced within quadrants, initial version will be fixed-size and static.
  *   **Summary:** Analyzed task requirements, confirmed project files, and noted implementation assumptions. Ready for architectural planning.
- [x] **Step 3 (Index 2):** Develop a modular high-level architectural plan, define a comprehensive testing strategy, and consider key non-functional requirements. Emphasize creating small, focused code units.
  *   **Result:** Developed a modular high-level architectural plan for the D3.js visualization. This includes structure for HTML, CSS, and JS files, with JS logic broken into functions for data definition, chart setup, axes, quadrants, blips, and legends. A testing strategy focusing on visual inspection and data accuracy was defined. Key NFRs: clarity, accuracy, maintainability (via modular code), and static output.
  *   **Summary:** Planned D3.js architecture (HTML, CSS, JS modules), testing strategy (visual, data accuracy), and NFRs.
- [x] **Step 4 (Index 3):** Validate the architectural plan and testing strategy with the user to ensure alignment and gather feedback.
  *   **Result:** User implicitly confirmed alignment with the architectural plan and testing strategy. A new request was made to create a 'data.md' file in the repository, detailing all initiatives and their attributes for the diagram. This task will be addressed next.
  *   **Summary:** Validated architectural plan and testing strategy with the user. User requested creation of 'data.md' with initiative details.
- [x] **Step 5 (Index 4):** Dynamically generate a detailed blueprint of implementation steps. Each step must cover code, tests (per strategy), documentation, quality checks, and commits, emphasizing modularity. Use 'manage_plan_step' to insert these into the plan.
  *   **Result:** Successfully generated and inserted a detailed blueprint of 10 sub-steps (plan steps 6 through 15) for implementing the D3.js visualization. These sub-steps cover HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript data definition, modular D3.js functions for chart components (setup, axes, quadrants, blips, legends), and an initial Git commit.
  *   **Summary:** Generated and inserted 10 detailed sub-steps for D3.js chart implementation into the plan.
- [x] **Step 6 (Index 5):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.1: Create index.html structure. This establishes the main page for the visualization.
  *   **Result:** Successfully wrote 'index.html' to '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/index.html'. The file includes the basic HTML structure, title, div containers for the chart and legends, and links to D3.js, style.css, and script.js.
  *   **Summary:** Created the main index.html file for the D3 visualization.
- [x] **Step 7 (Index 6):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.2: Create style.css with basic styles for the page and initial SVG elements.
  *   **Result:** Successfully wrote 'style.css' to '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/style.css'. The file includes basic styles for the page, chart container, and placeholder styles for D3-generated SVG elements like axes and labels.
  *   **Summary:** Created the style.css file with initial styles.
- [x] **Step 8 (Index 7):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.3: Initialize script.js and define initiative data for the 8 blips.
  *   **Result:** Successfully wrote 'script.js' to '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/script.js' with the 'initiativesData' array defining all 8 initiatives and their attributes, plus a DOMContentLoaded listener.
  *   **Summary:** Initialized script.js and defined initiative data array.
- [x] **Step 9 (Index 8):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.4: Implement setupChart() and initialize SVG in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully updated 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/' to include the 'initiativesData' array and the 'setupChart()' function. The function defines SVG dimensions, margins, creates the main SVG element, appends a group for chart content, and adds a background rectangle. The DOMContentLoaded listener now calls setupChart().
  *   **Summary:** Implemented setupChart() and initialized SVG in script.js.
- [x] **Step 10 (Index 9):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.5: Implement D3 scales and draw X/Y axes in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully updated 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/' to include 'defineScales()' and 'drawAxes()' functions. D3 point scales are defined for categorical axes, and axes are drawn with labels ('Low', 'Medium', 'High') and titles. DOMContentLoaded listener updated to call these functions.
  *   **Summary:** Implemented D3 scales and drew X/Y axes in script.js.
- [x] **Step 11 (Index 10):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.6: Implement quadrant lines and labels in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully updated 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/' to include the 'drawQuadrants()' function. This function draws the dividing lines and labels for the four quadrants ('Quick Wins', 'Big Bets', 'Fill-ins / Incrementals', 'Time Sinks / Reconsider') with their sub-labels. DOMContentLoaded listener updated to call this.
  *   **Summary:** Implemented quadrant lines and labels in script.js.
- [x] **Step 12 (Index 11):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.7: Implement Blip Circles (Position, Color, Size) in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully updated 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/' to include the first part of 'drawBlips()'. This function now creates SVG circle elements for each initiative, positioned within their correct quadrants using a helper function and jitter logic. Circles are colored by RTL Phase and sized by AI Integration Level. DOMContentLoaded listener updated to call this function.
  *   **Summary:** Implemented Blip Circles (Position, Color, Size) in script.js.
- [x] **Step 13 (Index 12):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.8: Implement Blip Text Labels in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully updated 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/' to complete the 'drawBlips()' function by adding text labels to each initiative blip. Labels are positioned below their respective circles for clarity.
  *   **Summary:** Implemented Blip Text Labels in script.js.
- [x] **Step 14 (Index 13):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.9: Implement Legends for RTL Phase Colors and AI Integration Sizes in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully updated 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/' to include the 'drawLegends()' function. This function creates and positions legends for RTL Phase colors and AI Integration Level sizes. The DOMContentLoaded listener now calls all functions to render the complete chart.
  *   **Summary:** Implemented Legends for RTL Phase Colors and AI Integration Sizes in script.js.
- [x] **Step 15 (Index 14):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.10: Commit initial D3.js visualization files.
  *   **Result:** Successfully committed 'index.html', 'style.css', 'script.js', and 'data.md' to the local Git repository in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map'. Commit message: 'feat: Initial D3.js matrix visualization with data, styles, and legends'.
  *   **Summary:** Committed initial D3.js visualization files to local Git.

# Execution Plan: D3.js RTL Prioritization Matrix Modifications

This document outlines the execution plan for modifying the D3.js visualization of the RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix based on user feedback.

## Goal
Modify the D3.js 'RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix' to improve blip label legibility and add 2 'Quick Wins' and 1 'Time Sink/Reconsider' initiative based on user feedback and previous RTL radar content.

## Plan Steps

- [x] **Step 1 (Index 0):** Establish project codebase in sandbox: if new, collaboratively determine name, attempt remote creation via github.create_repository (if available), then clone/init locally. If existing, clone. Then, process project-specific instruction files or README.md. This foundational context is paramount.
  *   **Result:** Successfully verified the existing project codebase 'rtl-blip-map' in the sandbox at '/workspace/rtl-blip-map'. All previously developed files are present, providing the correct baseline for the requested modifications.
  *   **Summary:** Confirmed existing project codebase in sandbox.
- [x] **Step 2 (Index 1):** Thoroughly understand the task and existing codebase (if any), guided by project rules. Analyze structure, conventions, and relevant files. Research external information and clarify ambiguities with the user until a solid understanding is achieved.
  *   **Result:** Thoroughly understood the task to modify the D3.js matrix: improve label legibility by adjusting spacing, and add 3 new initiatives ('Focused API Testing Adoption', 'Define Core Golden Paths' as Quick Wins; 'Hasty Microservices Migration' as Time Sink) with a new smaller blip size. This involves updating script.js (initiativesData, drawBlips, AI legend) and data.md. Existing codebase and conventions are clear.
  *   **Summary:** Understood modification tasks: label spacing, adding 3 new initiatives with new size, updating docs.
- [x] **Step 3 (Index 2):** Develop a modular high-level architectural plan, define a comprehensive testing strategy, and consider key non-functional requirements. Emphasize creating small, focused code units.
  *   **Result:** Developed an architectural plan for modifying the D3.js matrix. Plan includes: updating 'initiativesData' in script.js with 3 new initiatives (2 Quick Wins, 1 Time Sink) and a new smaller blip size category; adjusting 'drawBlips()' for better label spacing and placement of new blips; updating 'drawLegends()' for the new AI size category; and updating 'data.md'. Testing strategy focuses on visual inspection of label legibility, new blip appearance/placement, and legend updates, plus data accuracy checks.
  *   **Summary:** Planned modifications for D3.js matrix: label spacing, 3 new initiatives, updated docs and legends.
- [x] **Step 4 (Index 3):** Validate the architectural plan and testing strategy with the user to ensure alignment and gather feedback.
  *   **Result:** User confirmed alignment with the architectural plan and testing strategy for modifying the D3.js visualization. The plan includes updating script.js to add 3 new initiatives with a new blip size, adjusting label spacing, updating the AI legend, and updating data.md. Testing will focus on visual verification and data accuracy.
  *   **Summary:** Validated modification plan and testing strategy with the user; user confirmed alignment.
- [x] **Step 5 (Index 4):** Dynamically generate a detailed blueprint of implementation steps. Each step must cover code, tests (per strategy), documentation, quality checks, and commits, emphasizing modularity. Use 'manage_plan_step' to insert these into the plan.
  *   **Result:** Successfully generated and inserted a detailed blueprint of 4 high-level sub-steps (plan steps 6 through 9) for modifying the D3.js visualization and documentation. These cover updates to script.js (initiative data, label spacing, blip placement, AI legend), updates to data.md, and a final commit for these modifications.
  *   **Summary:** Generated and inserted 4 blueprint sub-steps for D3.js chart modifications.
- [x] **Step 6 (Index 5):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.1: Update initiative data and improve label spacing in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully modified 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/'. Added 3 new initiatives to 'initiativesData' ('Focused API Testing Adoption', 'Define Core Golden Paths' as Quick Wins; 'Hasty Microservices Migration' as Time Sink) with a new 'aiSize' of 7px. Adjusted 'drawBlips()' for improved label spacing (y-offset for labels now d.aiSize + 14) and updated jitter logic to correctly position items in 'Quick Wins' and 'Time Sinks / Reconsider' quadrants by adding new jitter patterns and updating the conditional logic.
  *   **Summary:** Updated script.js with 3 new initiatives, improved label spacing, and adapted jitter logic.
- [x] **Step 7 (Index 6):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.2: Update AI Integration Legend in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully modified 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/' to update the 'drawLegends()' function. The 'aiLevelsData' array within this function now includes the new 'Standard / Low AI' category with an 'aiSize' of 7px, ensuring the AI Integration legend is comprehensive.
  *   **Summary:** Updated AI Integration Legend in script.js with new size category.
- [x] **Step 8 (Index 7):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.3: Update data.md to document new initiatives.
  *   **Result:** Successfully updated 'data.md' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/'. The file now includes appended sections detailing the 3 new initiatives ('Focused API Testing Adoption', 'Define Core Golden Paths', 'Hasty Microservices Migration') with their attributes, Value/Effort rationale, and quadrant placement. The 'Blip Attributes' section was also updated to reflect the new 'Small' AI Integration Size.
  *   **Summary:** Updated data.md to document the 3 new initiatives and new AI size category.
- [x] **Step 9 (Index 8):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.4: Commit all modification changes.
  *   **Result:** Successfully committed the modifications to 'script.js' (new initiatives, label spacing, legend update) and 'data.md' (new initiative documentation) to the local Git repository in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map'. Commit message: 'feat: Add new initiatives (Quick Wins, Time Sink), improve label legibility, update legends and docs'.
  *   **Summary:** Committed all modification changes (script.js, data.md) to local Git.

- [ ] **Step 10 (Index 9):** Document the complete, detailed execution plan (including all dynamically generated steps) in a markdown file within the project's plans directory in the sandbox.
- [ ] **Step 11 (Index 10):** Perform final comprehensive validation: ensure all code compiles and all defined tests pass for the entire solution in the sandbox. 
- [ ] **Step 12 (Index 11):** Conduct a final code quality and security review, leveraging MCP tools if available. Plan for or execute minor self-corrections if issues are found.
- [ ] **Step 13 (Index 12):** Make a final commit of all implemented changes, including any fixes from the quality review. If remote repository information is available, push the code. 
- [ ] **Step 14 (Index 13):** Prepare a clear and concise summary of the completed work, how it meets the goal, and any relevant notes for the user. This will be part of the final completion message.

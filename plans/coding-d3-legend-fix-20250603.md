# Execution Plan: D3.js RTL Prioritization Matrix - Legend Layout Fix

This document outlines the execution plan for modifying the D3.js visualization of the RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix to fix the RTL Phase legend layout, based on user feedback.

## Goal
Modify the D3.js 'RTL 12-Month Initiative Prioritization Matrix' (version with 18 initiatives) to display the 'RTL Phase (Color)' legend in two columns to prevent it from being cut off.

## Plan Steps

- [x] **Step 1 (Index 0):** Establish project codebase in sandbox: if new, collaboratively determine name, attempt remote creation via github.create_repository (if available), then clone/init locally. If existing, clone. Then, process project-specific instruction files or README.md. This foundational context is paramount.
  *   **Result:** Successfully verified the existing project codebase 'rtl-blip-map' in the sandbox at '/workspace/rtl-blip-map'. File listing and last git commit (2adcb4c docs: Add execution plan for further D3 matrix modifications) confirm it's the correct baseline for the legend layout fix.
  *   **Summary:** Confirmed existing project codebase and its latest state (18 initiatives version) in sandbox.
- [x] **Step 2 (Index 1):** Thoroughly understand the task and existing codebase (if any), guided by project rules. Analyze structure, conventions, and relevant files. Research external information and clarify ambiguities with the user until a solid understanding is achieved.
  *   **Result:** Thoroughly understood the task to modify the RTL Phase legend in script.js to display in two columns. This involves: 
1. Updating the `transform` logic for `rtlLegendItems` in `drawLegends()` to calculate `x` and `y` for a two-column layout (e.g., 5 items in col1, 4 in col2 for 9 unique phases).
2. Calculating an appropriate `x` offset for the second column based on first column width.
3. Updating the `rtlLegendCalculatedWidth` used for positioning the AI legend to reflect the new two-column width of the RTL legend.
4. Aiming to fit within existing SVG margins. Existing codebase is clear.
  *   **Summary:** Understood legend modification task: two-column layout for RTL Phase legend in script.js.
- [x] **Step 3 (Index 2):** Develop a modular high-level architectural plan, define a comprehensive testing strategy, and consider key non-functional requirements. Emphasize creating small, focused code units.
  *   **Result:** Developed an architectural plan for modifying the RTL Phase legend in `script.js` to a two-column layout. Plan includes: 
1. Updating `drawLegends()` to calculate `x` and `y` positions for RTL legend items across two columns (e.g., 5 items in col1, 4 in col2 for 9 unique phases).
2. Dynamically calculating the width of the first column to determine the `x` offset for the second RTL column.
3. Updating the calculation for `rtlLegendCalculatedWidth` (used to position the AI legend) to account for the new total width of the two-column RTL legend.
4. Testing strategy focuses on visual inspection of the legend's two-column layout, item visibility, and correct relative positioning of the AI legend.
  *   **Summary:** Planned architectural changes for two-column RTL Phase legend in script.js.
- [x] **Step 4 (Index 3):** Validate the architectural plan and testing strategy with the user to ensure alignment and gather feedback.
  *   **Result:** User confirmed alignment with the architectural plan and testing strategy for modifying the RTL Phase legend layout. The plan to update `drawLegends()` in `script.js` to render this legend in two columns, dynamically calculate column widths, and adjust AI legend positioning accordingly, was approved. Testing will focus on visual verification.
  *   **Summary:** Validated legend fix plan with user; user approved two-column layout.
- [x] **Step 5 (Index 4):** Dynamically generate a detailed blueprint of implementation steps. Each step must cover code, tests (per strategy), documentation, quality checks, and commits, emphasizing modularity. Use 'manage_plan_step' to insert these into the plan.
  *   **Result:** Successfully generated and inserted a detailed blueprint of 2 high-level sub-steps (plan steps 6 and 7) for fixing the RTL Phase legend layout. These cover modifying 'script.js' to implement the two-column legend and adjust AI legend positioning, and then committing these specific changes.
  *   **Summary:** Generated and inserted 2 blueprint sub-steps for D3.js legend layout fix.
- [x] **Step 6 (Index 5):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.1: Implement two-column RTL Phase legend and adjust AI legend position in script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully modified 'script.js' in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map/' to implement a two-column layout for the RTL Phase legend in the 'drawLegends()' function. This included logic for distributing items into two columns, dynamically calculating first column width, and updating the x-offset for the AI legend to accommodate the new RTL legend width. The aim is to prevent the RTL legend from being cut off.
  *   **Summary:** Implemented two-column RTL Phase legend and adjusted AI legend position in script.js.
- [x] **Step 7 (Index 6):** Blueprint Sub-step 5.2: Commit legend layout modification to script.js.
  *   **Result:** Successfully committed the modification to 'script.js' (implementing a two-column layout for the RTL Phase legend and adjusting AI legend position) to the local Git repository in '/workspace/rtl-blip-map'. Commit message: 'fix: Adjust RTL Phase legend to two-column layout for visibility'.
  *   **Summary:** Committed legend layout modification (script.js) to local Git.

- [ ] **Step 8 (Index 7):** Document the complete, detailed execution plan (including all dynamically generated steps) in a markdown file within the project's plans directory in the sandbox.
- [ ] **Step 9 (Index 8):** Perform final comprehensive validation: ensure all code compiles and all defined tests pass for the entire solution in the sandbox.
- [ ] **Step 10 (Index 9):** Conduct a final code quality and security review, leveraging MCP tools if available. Plan for or execute minor self-corrections if issues are found.
- [ ] **Step 11 (Index 10):** Make a final commit of all implemented changes, including any fixes from the quality review. If remote repository information is available, push the code.
- [ ] **Step 12 (Index 11):** Prepare a clear and concise summary of the completed work, how it meets the goal, and any relevant notes for the user. This will be part of the final completion message.
